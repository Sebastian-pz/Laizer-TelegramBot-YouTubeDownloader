# Laizer TelegramBot - YouTube Downloader

This is a bot programmed for the Telegram platform using the Python as programming language.
You can access to it using `@seb_tfa_bot`
There are a few commands that you can use:
* `/help`
* `/start`
* `/commands-info`
* `/random-img`
* `/download {video url}`
* `And more...`

Currently in alpha version.

I am working to complete it and add some new features for next versions.

If you have any suggestion go ahead!

1. For use this code you need to install python, pyTelegramBotAPI and pyTube

    `$ pip install pyTelegramBotAPI`

    `$ pip install pytube`

3. Get and set your Bot token (using Bot Father) {actually I'm using .env file for save the token}

4. Start your bot using

    `$ python main.py`

Now you can chat with your bot!
