Seb_tfa_bot is a bot programmed for the Telegram platform using the Python programming language.
You can access to it using `@seb_tfa_bot`

Currently in alpha version.

I am working to complete it and add some new features for next versions.

If you have any suggestion go ahead!

1. For use this code you need to install python and pyTelegramBotAPI

    `$ pip install pyTelegramBotAPI`

2. Get and set your Bot token (using Bot Father)

3. Start your bot using

Now you can chat with your bot!
